# Full Stack Development Learning Path

This guide will walk you through building a full-stack todo application using React and NestJS. Follow these guides in order to build your application step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- Node.js installed (v14 or higher)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Git for version control

## Learning Path

### 1. JavaScript Fundamentals
Start with the JavaScript basics to build a strong foundation:

1. `javascript/getting-started.md` - Setting up your environment
2. `javascript/variables.md` - Variables and data types
3. `javascript/functions.md` - Functions and scope
4. `javascript/conditionals.md` - Control flow
5. `javascript/loops.md` - Iteration
6. `javascript/arrays-objects.md` - Data structures
7. `javascript/promises-async-await.md` - Asynchronous programming
8. `javascript/error-handling.md` - Error handling

### 2. React Basics
Learn React fundamentals:

1. `react/react-basics.md` - React fundamentals
2. `react/components.md` - Component creation
3. `react/state-management.md` - State and props
4. `react/hooks.md` - React Hooks
5. `react/forms.md` - Form handling
6. `react/routing.md` - Navigation

### 3. Backend Development
Set up the NestJS backend:

1. `backend/nestjs-basics.md` - NestJS fundamentals
2. `backend/controllers.md` - API endpoints
3. `backend/services.md` - Business logic
4. `backend/database.md` - Database integration
5. `backend/authentication.md` - User authentication

### 4. Full Stack Integration
Connect frontend and backend:

1. `full-stack/full-stack-integration.md` - Main integration guide
   - Follow the TODOs in order
   - Each section builds on the previous one
   - Complete all implementation steps before moving to testing

### 5. Advanced Topics
After completing the basic integration:

1. `react/react-advanced.md` - Advanced React patterns
2. `backend/backend-advanced.md` - Advanced backend concepts
3. `full-stack/advanced-features.md` - Additional features
