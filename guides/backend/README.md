# Backend Development Guide

## Learning Path

We recommend following this learning path to build a strong foundation in backend development:

### 1. Node.js & Express (Required for Beginners)
- Start with Express to learn fundamental backend concepts
- Simpler learning curve
- Direct exposure to HTTP concepts
- Great for understanding middleware and routing
- Perfect for building your first APIs

### 2. MongoDB & Mongoose (Optional for Beginners)
- Learn database concepts
- Understand data modeling
- Practice CRUD operations
- Build data-driven applications

### 3. NestJS (Advanced)
- Built on top of Express
- Adds TypeScript and enterprise patterns
- More structured and opinionated
- Better for large-scale applications
- Requires understanding of Express concepts

## Why Start with Express?

1. **Simpler Learning Curve**
   - More straightforward concepts
   - Less boilerplate code
   - Easier to understand HTTP fundamentals

2. **Direct Control**
   - More hands-on with HTTP concepts
   - Better understanding of middleware
   - Clearer view of request/response cycle

3. **Foundation for Advanced Topics**
   - Understanding Express makes NestJS easier to learn
   - Helps appreciate NestJS's additional features
   - Provides context for database integration
