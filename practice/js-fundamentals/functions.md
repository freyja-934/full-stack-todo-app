# JavaScript Functions Practice

## Question 1: Function Declaration

Create a function called `greet` that takes a name parameter and returns a greeting message.

## Question 2: Arrow Functions

Convert the following function to an arrow function:

```javascript
function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}
```

## Question 3: Function Parameters

Create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle. The function should accept width and height parameters, with default values of 1 if not provided.

## Question 4: Callback Functions

Create a function called `processArray` that takes an array and a callback function. The function should apply the callback to each element of the array and return the new array.

## Question 5: Closures

Explain what a closure is in JavaScript and provide an example of how you might use one.

## Question 6: Practice Exercise

Create a function called `filterTodos` that:
1. Takes an array of todo objects and a status parameter
2. Returns only the todos that match the given status
3. Each todo object has a `title` and `completed` property

# Functions Practice Exercises

These exercises will help you understand and practice working with functions in JavaScript.

## Exercise 1: Basic Functions

Write a function that returns the square of a number:

```javascript
// Your code here
```

## Exercise 2: Arrow Functions

Write an arrow function that takes two numbers and returns their sum:

```javascript
// Your code here
```

## Exercise 3: Function with Template Literals

Write a function that takes a name and returns "Good morning, {name}!":

```javascript
// Your code here
```

## Exercise 4: Function with Multiple Parameters

Create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle:

```javascript
// Your code here
```

## Exercise 5: Conditional Logic in Functions

Write a function that checks if a number is even or odd:

```javascript
// Your code here
```

## Exercise 6: Default Parameters

Create a function that calculates the total price of an item with tax, where tax is an optional parameter with a default value of 0.1 (10%):

```javascript
// Your code here
```

## Exercise 7: Function as First-Class Citizen

Create a function that takes another function as an argument and executes it twice:

```javascript
// Your code here
```

## Exercise 8: Callback Functions

Create a function that simulates fetching data from an API and uses a callback to handle the result:

```javascript
// Your code here
```

## Exercise 9: Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

Create an IIFE that creates a private counter and returns an object with methods to increment, decrement, and get the count:

```javascript
// Your code here
```

## Exercise 10: Function Returning a Function

Create a function that returns another function. The returned function should multiply its argument by a factor provided to the outer function:

```javascript
// Your code here
```

## Exercise 11: Function Scope

Create a function that demonstrates variable scope by declaring a variable inside the function and trying to access it outside:

```javascript
// Your code here
```

## Exercise 12: Practical Application - Todo List Functions

Create a set of functions for a simple todo list application:
- `addTodo(todoList, todo)`: Adds a new todo to the list
- `removeTodo(todoList, index)`: Removes a todo at the specified index
- `toggleComplete(todoList, index)`: Toggles the completion status of a todo
- `filterTodos(todoList, status)`: Returns todos filtered by completion status

```javascript
// Your code here
```

## Exercise 13: Challenge - Function Composition

Create a function that composes multiple functions together. The compose function should take any number of functions as arguments and return a new function that applies them from right to left:

```javascript
// Your code here
```
